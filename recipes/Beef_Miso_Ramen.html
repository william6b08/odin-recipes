  <h1>Beef Miso Ramen recipe</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Ramen is more than just a noodle soup,
    though it is indisputably one of the best. It's an international obsession,
    a dish with Chinese origins that's said to define modern Japanese food culture,
    and now enjoyed on every continent.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) beef sirloin steak</li>
    <li>1/2 cup gluten-free soy sauce (tamari)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon coconut oil</li>
    <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons miso paste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
    <li>2 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine steak and soy sauce in a plastic container with a lid.
      Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours.
    </li>
    <li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess.
      Discard the remaining marinade.
    </li>
    <li>Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.
      Add steak and cook until firm and reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
      An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium-rare.
      Remove from skillet and allow to rest for 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>While the steak is resting,
      combine broth, miso paste, garlic,
      and sesame oil in a saucepan over medium heat;
      bring to a boil. Once broth is at a slow boil,
      add ramen noodles. Cook until noodles are soft, about 3 minutes.
      Season with salt and pepper.
    </li>
    <li>Transfer broth and noodles to 2 bowls.
      Slice steak and place on top.
    </li>
  </ol>
